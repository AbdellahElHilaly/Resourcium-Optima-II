# Integration test (IT)
## What is an integration test?
An integration test is a test that verifies the communication paths and interactions between components to detect interface defects. The interaction between components can be in the form of a method call or a data transfer.
## What is the difference between unit test and integration test?
Unit tests are tests that verify the behavior of a single component. Integration tests are tests that verify the behavior of multiple components interacting with each other.
## What is the difference between integration test and end-to-end test?
Integration tests are tests that verify the behavior of multiple components interacting with each other. End-to-end tests are tests that verify the behavior of the entire system.
## What is the difference between integration test and system test?
Integration tests are tests that verify the behavior of multiple components interacting with each other. System tests are tests that verify the behavior of the entire system.
